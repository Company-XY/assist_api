User Model Documentation
Overview
The provided code defines a user model using Mongoose, a popular MongoDB Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js applications. This user model is intended for use in an application that involves user registration, authentication, and user profiles. The model includes various fields to capture user information and is designed to be used in a Node.js application.
Dependencies
Before using this user model, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed in your Node.js project:
•	mongoose: Mongoose is used for defining the schema and interacting with the MongoDB database.
•	bcrypt: Bcrypt is used for hashing and comparing passwords securely.
You can install these dependencies using npm or yarn:
bashCopy code
npm install mongoose bcrypt # OR yarn add mongoose bcrypt 
Save to grepper.

User Schema
The user schema defines the structure of user documents in the MongoDB collection. Below is a breakdown of the schema fields:
•	role (String): Specifies the user's role, which can be either "Client" or "Freelancer." This field is required.
•	type (String): Specifies the user's type, which can be selected from a predefined set of options. This field is required.
•	isAdmin (Boolean): Indicates whether the user is an administrator. It defaults to false.
•	bio (String): A user's biography or description.
•	name (String): The user's name. It must be unique.
•	email (String): The user's email address. It must be unique.
•	emailVerified (Boolean): Indicates whether the user's email has been verified. It defaults to false.
•	isApproved (Boolean): Indicates whether the user is approved. It defaults to false.
•	consultation (Boolean): Indicates whether the user offers consultation services. It defaults to false.
•	password (String): The user's hashed password. It is required.
•	phone (Number): The user's phone number. It must be unique.
•	phoneVerified (Boolean): Indicates whether the user's phone number has been verified. It defaults to false.
•	accountBalance (Number): The user's account balance. It defaults to 0.
•	avatar (Object): An object with title and fileUrl fields representing the user's avatar.
•	location (String): The user's location.
•	contactInfo (String): Additional contact information.
•	experience (String): A description of the user's experience.
•	skills (Array of Strings): An array of user skills.
•	tasks (Array of Strings): An array of user tasks.
•	availability (String): The user's availability.
•	sampleWork (Array of Objects): An array of objects containing title and fileUrl fields representing the user's sample work.
•	paymentMethod (String): The user's preferred payment method.
•	paymentRate (Number): The user's payment rate.
•	resetToken (String): A token used for password reset.
•	resetTokenExpiration (Date): The expiration date for the reset token.
•	rating (Number): The user's rating, which defaults to 0.
•	isVerified (Boolean): Indicates whether the user is verified. It defaults to false.

User Methods
The user model defines a method named matchPassword that is used to compare a provided password with the user's stored hashed password. This method is typically used for user authentication.
Usage.
To use this user model in your Node.js application, you can import it as follows:
javascriptCopy code
const mongoose = require("mongoose"); const bcrypt = require("bcrypt"); // Import the User model const User = require("./User"); // Replace with the actual path to your User model file // Your application code here... 
Save to grepper
You can then create, retrieve, update, and delete user documents using the User model and Mongoose methods.
Timestamps
The user schema includes the option { timestamps: true }, which automatically adds createdAt and updatedAt fields to user documents. These fields store the date and time when a document is created or updated, respectively.
Security Considerations
•	Ensure that you securely handle user passwords by using bcrypt for hashing and verifying passwords.
•	Implement proper validation and authorization checks based on your application's requirements to ensure user data security.
Conclusion
This user model provides a foundation for managing user data in a MongoDB database within your Node.js application. You can extend and customize it to suit your specific use case and application requirements.
